                                    Then he followed by saying the word out loud multiple times. Knowing how to say the word was the most important

                                  <b>To memorize new words is very slow, but once you learn them already, to review and go through them is super fast.</b> Let's say you start out by
                                  making 10 index cards for 10 words. It might take you 20 minutes to memorize these 10 new words, but it would only take you less than 1 minute
                                  to review all of them. This is how our brain works and keep this brain trick in mind. <b>When you memorize some new words today, you should constantly
                                   review them on a daily basis for about a month to get them really into your head. If you don't review the new words, you will forget them very
                                   quickly.</b> Memorizing new words is not a day thing; it is a month thing. Also, the advantage of using index card is that it is very
                                   <span title="'Portable' means 'something can be carried around easily">portable</span>. You can take the index cards with you and review them when you have time, such as in class, on a train,
                                     or before bed. Again, you only need 1 minute or less to review 10 words.

                                  in a good learning environment, Jay said it took him 3 years to perfect his speaking skills. <b>There is simply no shortcut.</b> The more you talk, the

                                   also provides some very good phrases for different <span title="'Scenarios' means 'events">scenarios</span>. For example, in a scenario when you don't get to hear what the other person is saying, which happens
                                   all the time, it suggests you to say "What was that again?" or "Pardon me?". Lastly, there are also many other ways where you can expose yourself to English,
                                    like watching movies and TV, or reading books. These are good ways, but <b>talking to people is the best way to overcome the language barrier. The key is talk, talk more
                                     and talk a lot more.</b>

                                    One day after class, he tolded Mr. Williams that he found this class very hard and asked him how could he improve his performance. Mr. Williams was very friendly and
                                    told John that he can always come to his office in lunch hour if he had any questions. Mr. Williams even found a senior student to tutor John individually. Thanks to
                                    this. John started to catch up slowly. (Even though John performance was near the edge of failing, he ended up getting a 90 in his class. There must be
                                    something special about people like Mr. Williams. They can somehow see that their students were trying and saw them beyond their failing test performance.)

                                 Of course, there are also people out there who are not going to help you, but someone eventually will. <b>Always be respectful to people and be grateful to those who offer their hands and

                                         things he've been doing in the school, NYU financial aid office actually awarded Xitang with some extra scholarships. In addition, Xitang happened also to

                                  to be good at it. He decided to go to the court and practice his jump shot for two hours every Sunday. He began his training by shooting basketball along
                                   the 10 different positions of the free throw lane. He first could get 4 out of 10 balls into the basket, then 8 out of 10 with weeks of practice and
                                   finally 10 out of 10 with months of practice. After this, he started to practice the more challenging free throws and three point shots. With some
                                   good shooting skills, he began playing matches in teams, but he kept losing and failed to make it into the school team. He soon found out that this
                                    is because basketball was also about teamwork and disciplines other than shootings. He started to sit next to the court everyday after school and
                                    watch how people play for the first two weeks, and began to watch how the professionals play in CBA and NBA later on. With weeks after weeks of
                                    learning and practicing, he made it to the school basketball team and even became the captain of the team. What he have learned from
                                    basketball in China continue to carry on with him when he moved to America. Basketball has trained him to be flexible, athletic and
                                    cooperative, and he was placed first in the NYC PSAL Boys Badminton Double Championships in 2014 Spring with his partner Lekka.<br></br>

                                  <b>If you want something, get moving. You don't need to have any fancy plan but action. Once you start moving, you will find your next step. </b>
                                  In Weichao's case, even though he was bad at playing basketball when started, he came up with a training plan the moment he got to the court.
                                  Then interest and desire play the second most important roles, because <b>your interest and desire decide whether you will go on or give up.</b>
                                  Because of Weichao's strong interest and desire to excel in basketball, he was able to maintain his rigor training every Sunday and continue
                                  to watch the NBA even till today (Basketball becomes part of his life). In addition, a great thing about interest is that <b>interest will take
                                  you to places you never imagined you would be in</b>. Following his interest, Weichao might know that he would become increasingly better at playing
                                   basketball, but he would not imagine that he will become the captain of his school team and even go on and win the badminton championship in NYC.
                                   So, <b>if you have something you want, just go after it right now. All the plans and thoughts will come to you once you start moving. If you really
                                   like what you are doing, you will have endless energy and motivation to keep going on. Eventually, your interest will bring you to places you never
                                   thought possible.</b> (On the other hand, if you give up on something easily, it might just be the fact that you don't want it and interest in it that
                                   much. If this happens, you should simply move on and find other things that you really want.)

                                workout equipments(like bars) provided in many parks, he was able to make the first move and started training himself in the park. When he first started,

                                   score. At that time, his performance was about 1400s and he was aiming to get 1800, because 1800 was good enough to get into most good schools. He bought

                        By the end of completing stage 2, you should have gotten a lot of things you wanted and are very confident about what you can achieve. Reaching your
                        American Dreams is just a matter of time and more efforts. Happiness comes if you reach what you wanted, but you will start to see that more happiness
                        comes if you help others reach what they wanted.

                        <p>(Today is the most enlightening time of human history. More and more people join the causes of helping to create a better world, helping others
                        to unlock their potentials and helping others to reach what they wanted. In a big scale, Facebook founder Mark and his wife Priscilla vow to donate 99% of their facebook
                        shares for education, science, health and community building to benefit the next generation. In a small scale, ShawnTina, a counselor in NYU and a board member of us, starts a non for profit to
                        help and empower youth in NYC. And you have Yuteng and Xitang right here, creating this website hoping to help fellow immigrants in some ways.)</p>

                        <p><b>Congratulations on finishing reading this guide and best wishes to your pursuit of your American Dream!</b> We, too, are pursuing our American Dreams.
                        Yuteng wants to work for his dream company Google and Xitang wants to become a leading figure in high tech, living in the frontier of possibility and helping to bring a wave of technology revolution in
                         China and across the world...</p>

                        <p class="title3">End Note:</p>
                        This website is a rather passive approach to reach out to fellow immigrants and other audience. There are certainly many other ways to reach one's American Dream and our stories might not be applicable to everyone,
                        but we hope those who find this site can get something out of it. In the future, Yuteng and Xitang might work on some more active approaches, but for now,
                        we will just leave it and see how it goes.
